# OpenDesign interview assignment - a simple 2D Remderer
Coding Challenge for the **C++ Developer** position at Ceros/OpenDesign - http://labs.ceros.com/jobs/#/job/4423147.

## TODO
Outside of the scope of this assignment are:
- Fully include RGBA Bitmap helper library (https://github.com/bzotto/rgba_bitmap/). Possibly as a git submodule.
- Improve test coverage. Cover all functionality with unit tests.
- Make `Image` and `Renderer` tests independent of the supplied image files. Use procedurally generated images as inputs.
- Use `OpenMP` to parallelize rendering.
